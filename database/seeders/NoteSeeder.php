In elementary algebra, those symbols (today written as Latin and Greek letters) represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables. The fundamental principle of algebra is the use of equations to solve for unknown values. Key concepts include: 1) Variables and constants, 2) Linear equations, 3) Quadratic equations, 4) Polynomials, 5) Factoring. Algebra forms the foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts and is essential in many fields including science, engineering, and economics.',
